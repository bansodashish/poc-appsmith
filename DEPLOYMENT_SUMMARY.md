## 🛠️ Infrastructure Components

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **VPC** | ✅ Ready | Custom VPC with public/private subnets |
| **ECR** | ✅ Ready | Container registry with vulnerability scanning |
| **ECS Cluster** | ✅ Ready | Fargate cluster with Container Insights |
| **ECS Service** | ✅ Ready | Auto-scaling service with rolling deployments |
| **ALB** | ✅ Ready | Application Load Balancer with health checks |
| **Security Groups** | ✅ Ready | Minimal access rules |
| **IAM Roles** | ✅ Ready | Least privilege access |
| **CloudWatch** | ✅ Ready | Logging and monitoring |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Setup AWS Infrastructure**
```bash
./deploy-setup.sh
```

### 2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
Add these to your GitHub repository settings:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### 3. **Deploy Your Application**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add ECS Fargate deployment pipeline"
git push origin main
```

### 4. **Monitor Deployment**
- Check GitHub Actions: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions`
- View ECS Console: AWS Console → ECS → Clusters → appsmith-cluster
- Access Application: Use ALB DNS name from deployment output

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment-Specific Deployments
- **Staging**: Automatic deployment on push to `main`
- **Production**: Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI

### Scaling Configuration
```bash
# Scale to 3 instances
aws ecs update-service --cluster appsmith-cluster --service appsmith-service --desired-count 3
```

### Custom Domain Setup
1. Create Route 53 hosted zone
2. Add SSL certificate to ALB
3. Update ALB listener for HTTPS

## 💡 Features Included

### 🔒 Security
- ✅ Private subnets for application
- ✅ Security groups with minimal access
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege
- ✅ ECR vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Secrets management ready

### 📊 Monitoring
- ✅ CloudWatch logs integration
- ✅ ECS Container Insights
- ✅ ALB access logs ready
- ✅ Health check monitoring
- ✅ Application performance monitoring

### 🔄 CI/CD
- ✅ Automated builds on push
- ✅ Docker layer caching
- ✅ Multi-platform builds
- ✅ Automated deployments
- ✅ Rollback capabilities

### 🎯 Deployment
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments
- ✅ Auto-scaling ready
- ✅ Health check integration
- ✅ Load balancing
- ✅ Service discovery

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Resources

### Quick Debug Commands
```bash
# Check ECS service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster appsmith-cluster --services appsmith-service

# View application logs
aws logs tail /ecs/appsmith --follow

# Check load balancer health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn $(aws elbv2 describe-target-groups --names appsmith-tg --query 'TargetGroups[0].TargetGroupArn' --output text)
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Build Failures** → Check GitHub Actions logs and AWS credentials
2. **Service Won't Start** → Check CloudWatch logs and task definition
3. **Health Check Failures** → Verify application health endpoint
4. **Cannot Access App** → Check security groups and ALB configuration

## 💰 Cost Estimation

**Monthly Costs (us-east-1)**:
- **Staging** (1 task): ~$78/month
- **Production** (3 tasks): ~$170/month

Includes: Fargate compute, ALB, NAT Gateway, CloudWatch logs

## 📞 Support

- **Infrastructure Issues**: Check Terraform state and AWS Console
- **CI/CD Issues**: Review GitHub Actions workflow logs  
- **Application Issues**: Consult Appsmith documentation
- **Deployment Guide**: See `ECS_DEPLOYMENT.md`
